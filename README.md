Real-world data analysis

## [Classification of Sign Language](https://www.kaggle.com/kotarosonoda/sign-language-cnn)
- Abstract: The pictures of sign language are classified into 24 groups using a deep neural network model which consists of convolution layers, max pooling layers, dropout layer, and densely-connected layer. In order to make the model robust against slight differences such as fist angles, hand position, and zoom level, data augmentation is performed. With this method, I finally achieved 99.5 % accuracy for a test dataset. 
- Mathods: Image data analysis, Convolutional neural network, Data augmentation
